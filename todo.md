# TODO

## Features to add

* Add reducer tests

## Bugs

* clear chat history is still kind of hacky
* No username remembering on browser refresh
* Make the server handle max_id tracking more elegantly
* Long polling gets called too many times when toggling between DDOS and long polling
* When the server disconnects, the auto-refresh is breaking or an infinite loop of some kind
